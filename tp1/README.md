## Project information

### Central Perk

This [scene](tp1/index.html) is based on the TV show [Friends](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends), more specifically the coffee shop [Central Perk](https://friends.fandom.com/wiki/Central_Perk).
It includes the infamous couches and table, as well as some background table and chair sets and a counter.
